    So this is a whole system.

    It needs to:
    = spawn powerups
      - at intervals
      - up to a maximum
      - either in empty spots or in predefined spawn points per level
      - from a set list of possible powerups per-level
    - apply powerups
      - to the paddle
      - to the ball
      - to the number of lives the player has
    - expire powerups
      -
